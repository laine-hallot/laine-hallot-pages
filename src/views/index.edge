                  TikTok Curl (named after the unix utility curl) is an Ios and Android app 
                  that lets users download a video from tiktok with or with out a watermarker.
                  I mostly just wrote it because the usual app I used to download Tiktok Videos on my 
                  phone had a ton of annoying fullscreen ads, so thought it might be nice to have an 
                  opensource app that doesn't have any ads. 
                  It's built with React Native and Typescript.
